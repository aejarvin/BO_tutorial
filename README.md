This repository provides a very simple toy example of Bayesian optimization.
This is provided in connection to a EUROfusion webinar February 14th 2024 with the 
intention to provide a very easy test case for the audience to try BO themselves.

Requirements:
PyTorch - https://pytorch.org/
GPyTorch - https://gpytorch.ai/
BoTorch - https://botorch.org/
SciencePlots - https://pypi.org/project/SciencePlots/1.0.1/

If these are not installed, pip installing botorch and scienceplots, should be sufficient:
    pip install botorch
    pip install scienceplots
